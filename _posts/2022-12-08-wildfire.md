## Wildfire UAVs Motivation and Overview

Climate change continues to exacerbate the severity of wildland fires. As shown in the below video, firefighters need increased and timely situational awareness to operate safely in these dangerous environments.

{% youtube P8zU1MjZSnE %}

We are conducting research to develop robust Unmanned Aerial Systems to aid in wildfire monitoring. The hazardous, dynamic, and visually degraded environment of wildfire gives rise to many unsolved fundamental research challenges. We aim to conduct integrative research that enables autonomous systems to operate robustly under high uncertainty and risk.


## Systems: Drone Platform
We built a robotics platform designed for wildland fire monitoring. The drone is outfitted with thermal cameras, RGB, and LiDaR sensors. It perceives and maps fire, and streams back video, mapping, and telemetry information in real time up to a 1km distance.

Many thanks to our team from the Master's in Robotics Systems Development (MRSD) program for their leadership in creating the system.

## Planning

{% youtube IgvxBOlDikw %}

Informative path planning is an important research topic in robotics with several applications in the spatiotemporal monitoring domain. Most works only consider planning on static information maps or short-horizon planning, whereas many real world scenarios call for planning on the dynamics of an environment with evolving information. Planning with growing and dynamic uncertainty presents a unique challenge requiring long-term horizon planning for globally optimal trajectories. In this work we describe dynamic information maps and develop approaches based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for long-horizon planning. We first develop an MCTS that uses informed time-aware actions to plan an optimal trajectory in the dynamic map. We further build upon this method with a learned approach that directly predicts the future value of a state instead of requiring a computationally intensive rollout. We demonstrate that both these methods outperform a primitive action MCTS baseline on a multitude of randomly generated experiments.



## Simulator: Wildfire AirSim

{% youtube HrZQgI72u5I %}

We develop a robotics simulator for autonomous aerial monitoring of wildland fires. We implement the simulator with AirSim, Unreal Engine 4, and GridFire.

Access our open source simulator on our [GitHub](https://github.com/castacks/WildfireAirSim).

## Future Plans

We're fortunate and thankful to have been awarded a three-year grant from the [National Science Foundation's National Robotics Initiative](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/national-robotics-initiative-30-innovations). The funding is scheduled for 2023-2026. We aim to pursue the following research initiatives:
