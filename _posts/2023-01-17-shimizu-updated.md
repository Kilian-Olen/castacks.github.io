# Overview #

During a 4-year research collaboration with an international corporation in civil engineering ([Shimizu Institute of Technology](https://www.shimz.co.jp/en/company/about/sit/)), people in the AirLab built several specialized sensor components and robots to explore the possibilities of applying our knowledge and skills to the commonwealth of the general public.

With the target of enabling automated infrastructure inspection for structures such as buildings and bridges, we developed a series of sensor payload and drone systems that are able to automatically collect multi-model data, with an offline reconstruction system that utilizes the data collected to reconstruct the dense 3D model of the structure with geometric details and colored textures. The reconstructed data can be utilized for inspection purposes such as surface defect detection and quantification. They can also be further processed into 3D geometries that are suitable for scientific and engineering computation and analysis, e.g. structural safety analysis.
