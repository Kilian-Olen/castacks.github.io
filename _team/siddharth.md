I am a first-year MS in Robotic Systems Development student at Carnegie Mellon University. I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2021, attaining a Bachelorâ€™s (with Honors) in Mechanical Engineering and a Minor degree in the Department of Computer Science.

My interests lie in legged robots, planning, and exploration.
