Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Andrew, a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute. My research interests involve multi-agent systems and planning for real world applications. I work on autonomous drones for wildfire assistance and disaster relief. I previously graduated from San Jose State University with a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics.

On weekends, I enjoy playing basketball, volleyball, badminton, and tennis. I'm also part of CMU's [C# vocal music club](https://www.cmucsharp.com/). I'm always on the lookout for my next adventure.
